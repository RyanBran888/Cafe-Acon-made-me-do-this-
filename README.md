#i tried making a paper airplane throwing machine but i didnt really finish it in time, and i couldnt really test it but inm theory it works if you have a really small paper airplane

you put the paper airplane between the two arm thingies and then you turn on the motors and it spins really fast and you attatch a string to one of the arm thingies whic is attatched to a servo, adn then you press a button and pull the string with a servo and then it releases the paper airplane and it flies really fast
