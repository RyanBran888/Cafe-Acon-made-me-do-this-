# Paper airplane throwing machine


I tried making a paper airplane-throwing machine, but I didn't really finish it in time, and I couldn't really test it, but in theory it works if you have a really small paper airplane.

You put the paper airplane between the two arm thingies, and then you turn on the motors, and it spins really fast, and you attach a string to one of the arm thingies, which is attached to a servo, and then you press a button and pull the string with a servo, and then it releases the paper airplane, and it flies really fast.

Included in the repo is the CAD model for the project.
